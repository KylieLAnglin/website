I am an assistant professor of research methods, measurement, and evaluation currently at the Neag School of Education at the University of Connecticut. As an educational methodologist, I am committed to identifying effective educational programs and policies. 

My research interests center on identifying effective educational programs and policies and using data science tools such as natural language processing to better understand the implementation of educational programs at the local level, at scale. 

**I am currently taking on PhD students. Please email me and/or [apply](https://rmme.education.uconn.edu/how-to-apply-m-a-and-ph-d-programs/) if you are interested.**


In recent research, I developed scalable methods for [collecting local policy data](https://doi.org/10.1080/19345747.2019.1654576) from school district websites and used that data to estimate the impact of widescale [deregulation](https://doi.org/10.3102/01623737231176509) of school districts. I have also developed methods for [measuring fidelity](https://doi.org/10.1177/23328584211028615) in standardized educational interventions and for improving [training data](https://doi.org/10.6339/22-JDS1054) used to train machine learning classifiers. You can see a complete list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vowl-BoAAAAJ&hl=en). 


I became interested in evaluation and implementation when teaching middle schoolers. As a teacher, I wanted to know what programs would work for *my* students and *our* circumstances, not the average student in the average circumstances. Today, I address these questions by helping researchers identify causally valid program impacts while paying attention to variation in implementation, ensuring that average outcomes do not hide inequalities.
